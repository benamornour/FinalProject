# FinalProject
Our project is an e-learning project designed for children between 3-6 years old , where they learn new tools and skills in a new and funny way because we believe that learning should be joyous . "Our platform is designed to be user-friendly, making it accessible for kids to navigate while allowing parents to supervise and keep a watchful eye on their activities."
